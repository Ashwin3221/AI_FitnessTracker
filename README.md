# AI_FitnessTracker


It is an AI based Fitness Tracker using OpenCV and Python. It can detect various body postures like bicep curls, squats and so on. We have used the pose estimation to find the correct points and using these points we'll get the desire angles. This tracker is going to track different fitness activities and render the results to the screen.


_Steps to follow : 
  STEP 1 :   First we need to install and import all the necessary libraries such as numpy, mediapipe and opencv. Then starting with capturing video from webcam and setting up                  mediapipe instance.
  STEP 2  :   Extracting the coordinates and joining them. Then it will find the angle between three defined coordinates.
  STEP 3  :   At last we've applied the logic of curls counting, thereby by diplaying the counts on the screen.

TechStack : **Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe.**
